# Corona Cafeteria
This app is intended to allow users to create a restaurant/bar (establishment) that will be added to a connected database. From there one can edit the status of their establishment. Such as, if there is curbside pickup or tables available for dine-in in real time. Also, a menu can be created, edited and deleted in real time. Anyone can browse the site and all the establishments that have been saved to the database. If a user is logged in they can comment on individual establishments and delete their own comments if needed. The site has been optimized for both mobile and desktop.
